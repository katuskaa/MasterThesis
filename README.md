# Annotation
Abductive reasoning is still a novel and non-standard reasoning technique in the area of description logics. Several work have yielded abductive reasoners, however such approaches often have to search through a vast space of possible explanations. This opens space for heuristic and other techniques which would enable to cut down the search space and improve effectivity.

# Goal
To develop optimization techniques for an existing abductive description logics reasoner with the aim to improve computational effectivity.
